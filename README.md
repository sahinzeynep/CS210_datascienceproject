This project unfolds a personal odyssey through the digital auditory landscapes of Spotify, aiming to decipher the unique tapestry of music and podcast preferences. As part of the CS 210 Introduction to Data Science course, this term project not only delves into the challenges of data cleaning and manipulation but also explores the fascinating realms of exploratory data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

Before venturing into the analytical realm, I engaged in extracting, cleaning, and transforming raw data. Converting JSON files into structured data frames and CSV files laid a practical foundation for subsequent exploration. Focusing on streaming history, playlists, search queries, and library content provided a comprehensive snapshot of my interaction with the Spotify platform.

The EDA journey involved peering into my personal musical landscape. Analyzing my top 20 played songs and artists, exploring least-played tracks and artists based on play duration, and scrutinizing listening habits over time unveiled patterns and trends. Monthly and weekly analyses highlighted variations in stream count and total play duration, while examining daily patterns uncovered specific times of heightened listening activity.

Formulating hypotheses brought structure to the exploration. One hypothesis tested whether I tend to listen more during weekdays than weekends. Conducting t-tests on the number of streams and total play duration for weekdays versus weekends yielded insights into my weekly listening habits.

The journey into machine learning involved anomaly detection and track preference prediction. Utilizing the Isolation Forest model, anomalies in listening behavior were identified and visualized. Predicting liked or disliked tracks based on play duration was achieved through a Random Forest classifier, providing a glimpse into potential preferences.

In conclusion, this project seamlessly blends music and data science, offering a deep dive into personal Spotify habits. The findings provide insights into listening preferences, temporal patterns, and even potential anomalies. The exploration serves as a testament to the versatility of data science, uncovering hidden facets of personal habits through the lens of Spotify data.
